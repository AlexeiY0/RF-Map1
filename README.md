Some typical electro-magnetic radiation (EMR) measurements around Auckland. The measurements were taken with an emf-390 meter. The power density units are milli-watts per meter squared (mW/m2). The GPS coordanates were logged using an android phone. The GPS and EMR were combined by the timestamp to give a geospatial representation.

Each dot represents a data point and is colour coded to indicate the magnitude. You can hover over each data point to see the measured value. You can select which recordings to view by clicking on the checkboxes in the legend. You can filter the data by the power density with the slider in the top right. The emf-390 also records the source of the radiation (only a crude estimation). You can filter the data by the source (hold down CTRL and Click to select several sources). Click 'clear filter' below each filter to reset.
